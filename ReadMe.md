Galen.Ef.Deployer is a small collection of tools that complement Entity Framework Code First Migrations in order to enable fully automated schema and data deployments, whether it be part of your continuous integration process or local development.

Right now this tooling is being iterated very quickly internally at Galen and we expect it to be much easier to integrate into your own solutions over the next couple months. That said, the entire solution is here, just review the examples.

We'd love to hear from you, whether it be questions or contructive feedback. Shoot us an email at dev@galenhealthcare.com.
