Demo 1.0:

 - overview
 - build data
 - run Demo1Deploy.ps1
 - SSMS show database and data

Demo 1.5: 

 - modify patient domain entity

 - add new migration too add new tables and drop a column

     update-database -ConnectionString "Data Source=(localdb)\mssqllocaldb;Initial Catalog=DoesntMatter;Integrated Security=True;" -ConnectionProviderName "System.Data.SqlClient"
	 Add-Migration "ClinicalSchemaAddAddressAsFirstClassCitizen" -ConnectionString "Data Source=(localdb)\mssqllocaldb;Initial Catalog=DoesntMatter;Integrated Security=True;" -ConnectionProviderName "System.Data.SqlClient"

 - manually modify the created migration to backfix existing data (support ordering and backfix)

     - create new table should happen first
     - sql-based data backfix
	 - drop obsolete column last

	 - backfix sql:
		UP:
			INSERT INTO [demo1].[Address] (ID, PATIENTID, LINEONE, LINETWO, CITY, STATE, ZIP)
					SELECT NEWID() as ID,
					ID as PatientId, LineOne, LineTwo, City,
					SUBSTRING(TheRest, 1, CHARINDEX(',', TheRest)-1) AS State, 
					SUBSTRING(TheRest, CHARINDEX(',', TheRest)+1, LEN(TheRest)) AS Zip 
					FROM (
						SELECT ID, LineOne, LineTwo, 
						SUBSTRING(TheRest, 1, CHARINDEX(',', TheRest)-1) AS City, 
						SUBSTRING(TheRest, CHARINDEX(',', TheRest)+1, LEN(TheRest)) AS TheRest 
						FROM (
							SELECT ID, LineOne, 
							SUBSTRING(TheRest, 1, CHARINDEX(',', TheRest)-1) AS LineTwo, 
							SUBSTRING(TheRest, CHARINDEX(',', TheRest)+1, LEN(TheRest)) AS TheRest 
							FROM (
								SELECT Id,
								SUBSTRING([Address], 1, CHARINDEX(',', [Address])-1) as LineOne,
								SUBSTRING([Address], CHARINDEX(',', [Address])+1, LEN([Address])) as TheRest
								FROM [demo1].[Patient]
							) foo1
						) foo2
					) foo3
		DOWN:
			UPDATE DEMO1.Patient
					SET [ADDRESS] = FOO.[ADDRESS]
					FROM
					(
						SELECT PatientId, 
						[LineOne] +', '+ +', '+ [LineTwo] +', '+ [City] +', '+ [State] +', '+ [Zip] AS [Address]
						FROM [demo1].[Address]
					) FOO
					WHERE FOO.PatientId = Id

 Demo 1.75:
 
 - lets say for some reason we need to roll back
   - darn accounting team and their custom microsoft access databases that secretly were pulling data from the database(s) who's schema we modified
   - sounds crazy i know, but you obviously never worked at a financial company if you dont think this happens
   - anyway, we need to roll back
 - rolling back == deploying old version, so thats what were going to do. we'll "undo" the stuff from demo 1.5, going back to demo 1.0 state
 - undo changes (grab a new copy of the solution if not connected to TFS), build and run deploy script
